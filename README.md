# NYT_Most_Popular
In my CIS197 assignment, I wrote a node script that uses callback functions and async/await to interface with the New York Times API. The final product outputs the five topics that are currently most popular among NYT readers, as well as links to recent articles related to each of the topics. This script allows someone with not lot of time to keep up with the news.
